# CNC-TicTacToe
This is the major project of our group for the partial completion of Bachelor's in Electronics, Communication and Information Engineering. The project is a CNC machine that can both draw and play Tic-Tac-Toe. We used Arduino with GRBL, CNC shield, A4988 motor drivers, Nema-16 Stepper Motors(X-axis & Y-axis)) and a servo motor(Z-axis).
